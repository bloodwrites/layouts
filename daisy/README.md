# Daisy Layout

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

I loved this image when I saw it. Purple is the perfect colour for the internet, I've decided. And the flower is pretty, idk. I'm not good at girly things.

This layout is properly mobile-friendly/fully responsive. It's actually not that hard to do, and with very little styling. HTML pages should _always_ have the below snippet between the <head></head> tags, to ensure that they don't look like shit on mobile devices:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

Often, that's all you need to make a site 'just work' for both desktop and mobile browsers.

### Layout Colours

**Background:** #310E2E  
**Text:** #FFFFFF or 'white'  
**Links/Accent:** #FDE65D

### Layout Fonts

**Headings:** Great Vibes  
**Body:** Ubuntu

Fonts served by ðŸ¤® Google, because brick.im didn't have Great Vibes. My apologies.

## Some Garbage Instructions

First, download the layout package, by hitting the 'Code' button up top and choosing 'download ZIP'. Extract the zip file, and put the contents somewhere convenient for you to work.

Open the index.html file in a plain text editor like Notepad or something that won't screw up HTML (definitely not Word or Office or anything that is designed to make things pretty - pretty is bad).

Go through the file and replace or edit anything that looks like it needs editing, such as titles, links, descriptions etc.

The basic structure of the page is made up of HTML tags as follows:

`<header></header>`  
`<nav></nav>`  
`<section></section>`  
`<footer></footer>`

If you don't want any of these parts, you can delete them, including their contents, but there must be at least one `<section></section>` remaining or your text will be all over the unblurred background and you won't be able to read anything.

If you want to switch the colours, open the style.css file and edit the :root section (near the top of the file). Good luck.

Likewise if you wish to switch the fonts, but you also have to replace the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Great+Vibes&family=Ubuntu">` in the head of index.html.
